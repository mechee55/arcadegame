# Classic Arcade Game

This is another project in Udacity's frontend nanodegree program, which requires Object-Oriented-Programming.
( Here's the link to Udaicty's [Object-Oriented JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) )

This game was created with vanilla JavaScript.

## How to play the game

1.  Open this [link](https://mechee55.github.io/arcadegame/.)
2.  Use only the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your player.
3.  Avoid the bugs that moves at random speeds horizonatally.
4.  If you hit a bug, your player will be sent back to the original position.
5.  If you make it to the river, you will also be sent back to the original position! (no counter :( )
